This mod adds more lore-friendly dialogues for party members, that previously had none. 

New interactions increase amount of post-combat party banter by **at least 4 times**, when compared to original game + DLC.

*Note: 'A New Home' DLC is NOT required, although majority of new content is only available in post-game.*

# Extended Party Dialogue
![Extended party dialogue](docs/images/party_dialogue.png)

*CrossCode: Extra Dialogue* features new dialogue for **16 different parties**, which were not covered by the original game. 

Numbers say it all. The mod adds approximately 7500 words of text, which is almost a size of novelette!

We paid extra attention to keeping new dialogues lore-friendly and true to characters personalities, while also making them interesting and expanding a little bit on the world of CrossCode.

Just like in the original game, new dialogues play out after finishing combat.

# Additional features
## Reactive Banter
![Reactive banter](docs/images/reactive_banter.png)

Party dialogue may have subtle changes based on which other dialogues have already played out, how certain past events have unfolded, active NG+ modifiers and even your personal stats, like current level.

## Extended Miscellaneous Banter
![Miscellaneous banter](docs/images/miscellaneous.png)

We added a few extra lines for miscellaneous events to characters, that had the least amount of them.

It mostly concerns equipment upgrade and finishing combat with S rank.

## Custom Expressions
